**Learning the C programming language.**
_Arseny gives me **easy**, **middle** and **hard** tasks, and I, in turn, have to solve them. I have an opportunity to ask him something, he will tell me about it in detail and also will teach me how to write correct and clean code. In turn, this will give me a good knowledge of the C programming language and writing code in it._
